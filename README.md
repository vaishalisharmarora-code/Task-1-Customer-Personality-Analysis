# Task-1-Customer-Personality-Analysis
Aim:
To clean and prepare a raw dataset in MS Excel, handling null values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats for further analysis.

Process:
I began by creating a Kaggle account and downloading the dataset on Customer Personality Analysis. Using MS Excel, I:

Converted the raw data into organized rows and columns.

Added a serial number column for reference.

Applied bold formatting and color to headings, ensured data alignment, and wrapped text for better readability.

Replaced null values in the Income column with blanks.

Standardized the date format to DD-MM-YYYY.

Replaced irrelevant “mnt” placeholders (money spent on wine, fruit, fish, meat, and sweets) with blanks for clarity.

Applied filters to enable detailed observation and analysis.

Observation:
The dataset covered 2,240 surveyed customers to understand purchasing behavior. However, some dates of birth—1893, 1899, and 1900—appear unrealistic. Considering the world’s oldest living person today is 116-year-old British woman Ethel Caterham, these entries are likely hypothetical or erroneous values rather than actual birth years.
